# Non-Primals


## Introduction
The nature / theme of the Non-Primal Cards are usually a reflection of that of the realworld business of the issuing entity.
The first Non-Primal Card Set, is issued as a tribute to the _famous pornstar_ __Akiho Yoshizawa__ by one of the producing company called Maxing, here is it's website.(Warning: it's all Japanese and without SSL) [Maxing](http://www.maxing.jp/top/).

## Features of Non-Primal Cards

### Houses and Jokers
Non-Primal Cards are __ALWAYS__ issued as _Solidarity Poker Cards_. Like all poker card sets, there are 4 different __Houses__: Spades, Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds. And there are 2 Jokers, the "Fake Joker" and the "Real Joker". That's __(13 x 4) + 2 = 54__ Cards.

### Inscriptions
Apart from the _"Normal"_ property of Poker Cards, there are also inscriptions imprinted on each one of the cards. These, are the 54 Katakana of the Japanese Language. So, that added 54 different varieties to each one of the card.

### Total Unique Varieties 
With all the Houses, Joker and Inscription, a single deck of Non-Primal Card collection has __((13 x 4) + 2) * 54 = 54 * 54 = 2916__ unique varieties.

> With inscription: [い]
> ::item[Two of Spades]{id=1 asset_type=card rarity=uncommon lang=en}

> With inscription: [あ]
