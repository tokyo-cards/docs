# Non-Primals


## Introduction
The nature / theme of the Non-Primal Cards are usually a reflection of that of the realworld business of the issuing entity.
The first Non-Primal Card Set, is issued as a tribute to the _famous pornstar_ __Akiho Yoshizawa__ by one of the producing company called Maxing, here is it's website.(Warning: it's all Japanese and without SSL) [Maxing](http://www.maxing.jp/top/).

## Features of Non-Primal Cards

### Houses and Jokers
Non-Primal Cards are __ALWAYS__ issued as _Solidarity Poker Cards_. Like all poker card sets, there are 4 different __Houses__: Spades, Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds. And there are 2 Jokers, the "Fake Joker" and the "Real Joker". That's __(13 x 4) + 2 = 54__ Cards.

### Inscriptions
Apart from the _"Normal"_ property of Poker Cards, there are also inscriptions imprinted on each one of the cards. These, are the 54 Katakana of the Japanese Language. So, that added 54 different varieties to each one of the card.

### Total Unique Varieties 
With all the Houses, Joker and Inscription, a single deck of Non-Primal Card collection has __((13 x 4) + 2) * 54 = 54 * 54 = 2916__ unique varieties.

So, there exists 54 different versions __Two of Spades__, here are 2 of them:

> With inscription: [い]
> ::item[Two of Spades]{id=1 asset_type=card rarity=uncommon lang=en}

> With inscription: [あ]
> ::item[Two of Spades]{id=0 asset_type=card rarity=uncommon lang=en}

## Obtaining the Non-Primals

### The Polygon Network Version
#### From Purchasing
It's possible to obtain a single random Non-Primal Card from a lootbox on this website. Or it's possible to find a seconded hand one on Opensea.io

[Portal to the Lootbox Page](/temple/?lang=en&tab=1) (Must Install Metamask)

[Portal to the Opensea Page]() (Must Install Metamask)

#### From Crafting 
It's also possible to get one card from a [Card Forger](/wiki/?slug=classes&lang=en#forger). A [Card Forger]() will help to [Forge]() a Non-Primal Card with 4 [Primals](/wiki/?slug=/collectables/primals&lang=en) of the same rarity.

Of course, the [Card Forger]() will be happy to collect a fee from doing so.

For example:

> With the following 4 Primal Cards
> ::item[Arcane Iordium Mote]{id=2916 asset_type=card rarity=uncommon lang=en} 
> ::item[Violet Iordium Mote]{id=2917 asset_type=card rarity=uncommon lang=en} 
> ::item[Lima Iordium Mote]{id=2918 asset_type=card rarity=uncommon lang=en} 
> ::item[Scarlet Iordium Mote]{id=2919 asset_type=card rarity=uncommon lang=en} 
> A Card Forger will be able to Forge a random card of [Uncommon]() quality from a chosen card set.

### The Ethereum Network Version
The Ethereum Network Version is only available from our Fiat NFT Exchange [Adam by GMO](https://adam.jp). It's possible to puchase a card from them and __withdraw__ into a person's private wallet. A swap contract will become available to swap their __ERC721__ contract to our __ERC1155__ version. 

For more details, see [Technology Specs](/wiki/?slug=tech_spec&lang=en)

## How do I become a Card Forger ?
Anyone who successfully collects a full set of of cards with the same inscriptions, will be automatically granted [Gloves of the Ethereum Forger]() (from the Ethereum Version) which enables a person to froge Non-Primal Card with [Primals](/wiki/?slug=/collectables/primals&lang=en) at the highest level.

It's slightly different for Polygon.
