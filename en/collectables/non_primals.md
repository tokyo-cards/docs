# Non-Primals


## Introduction
The nature / theme of the Non-Primal Cards are usually a reflection of that of the realworld business of the issuing entity.
The first Non-Primal Card Set, is issued as a tribute to the _famous pornstar_ __[Akiho Yoshizawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiho_Yoshizawa)__ by one of the producing company called Maxing, here is it's website.

## Features of Non-Primal Cards

### Houses and Jokers
Non-Primal Cards are __ALWAYS__ issued as _Solidarity Poker Cards_. Like all poker card sets, there are 4 different __Houses__: Spades, Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds. And there are 2 Jokers, the "Fake Joker" and the "Real Joker". That's __(13 x 4) + 2 = 54__ Cards.

### Inscriptions
Apart from the _"Normal"_ property of Poker Cards, there are also inscriptions imprinted on each one of the cards. These, are the 54 Hirakana of the Japanese Language. Here is a link of Wikipedia about it. [Hirakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana) That adds 54 different varieties to each one of the card.

### Total Unique Varieties 
With all the Houses, Joker and Inscription, a single deck of Non-Primal Card collection has __((13 x 4) + 2) * 54 = 54 * 54 = 2916__ unique varieties.

Thus, there exists 54 different versions __Two of Spades__, here are 2 of them:

## Obtaining the Non-Primals

### The Polygon Network Version
#### From Purchasing

#### From Crafting 
It's also possible to get one card from a [Card Forger](/wiki/?slug=classes&lang=en#forger). A [Forger](/wiki/?slug=classes&lang=en#forger) will help to __Forge__ a Non-Primal Card with 1 [Primals](/wiki/?slug=/collectables/primals&lang=en) of the same rarity.

Of course, the [Forger](/wiki/?slug=classes&lang=en#forger) will be happy to collect a fee from doing so.

For example:

> With the following 1 Primal Cards
> ::item[Arcane Iordium Mote]{id=2916 asset_type=card rarity=uncommon lang=en} 
> A Card Forger will be able to Forge a random card of [Uncommon](/wiki/?slug=/collectables/rarity&lang=en#uncommon) quality from a chosen card set.

### The Ethereum Network Version
The Ethereum Network Version is only available from our Fiat NFT Exchange [Adam by GMO](https://adam.jp). It's possible to puchase a card from them and __withdraw__ into a person's private wallet. A swap contract will become available to swap their __ERC721__ contract to our __ERC1155__ version. 

For more details, see [Technology Specs](/wiki/?slug=tech_spec&lang=en)

## How do I become a Card Forger ?
Anyone who successfully collects a __FULL HOUSE__ , will be automatically granted 

::item[Forger's Hammer]{id=2916 asset_type=card rarity=uncommon lang=en} 

which enables a person to froge Non-Primal Card with [Primals](/wiki/?slug=/collectables/primals&lang=en)
