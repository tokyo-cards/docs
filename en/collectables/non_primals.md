# Non-Primals


## Introduction
The nature / theme of the Non-Primal Cards are usually a reflection of that of the realworld business of the issuing entity.
The first Non-Primal Card Set, is issued as a tribute to the _famous pornstar_ __[Akiho Yoshizawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiho_Yoshizawa)__ by one of the producing company called Maxing, here is it's website.

## Features of Non-Primal Cards

### Houses and Jokers
Non-Primal Cards are __ALWAYS__ issued as _Solidarity Poker Cards_. Like all poker card sets, there are 4 different __Houses__: Spades, Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds. And there are 2 Jokers, the "Fake Joker" and the "Real Joker". That's __(13 x 4) + 2 = 54__ Cards.

### Inscriptions
Apart from the _"Normal"_ property of Poker Cards, there are also inscriptions imprinted on each one of the cards. These, are the 54 Hirakana of the Japanese Language. Here is a link of Wikipedia about it. [Hirakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana) That adds 54 different varieties to each one of the card.

### Total Unique Varieties 
With all the Houses, Joker and Inscription, a single deck of Non-Primal Card collection has __((13 x 4) + 2) * 54 = 54 * 54 = 2916__ unique varieties.

Thus, there exists 54 different versions __Two of Spades__, here are 2 of them:
