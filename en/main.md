# Welcome
Welcome to the Tokyo.Cards Documentation !

The __definitive__ wiki resource for (X)³™ Collectables, and other collections that are developed by Tokyo Cards.

# Introduction
Tokyo.Cards is a decentralized organization that dedicates itself to the cause of bringing more Web 3.0 applications into real life. The organization is named after Tokyo, the capital city of Japan, for Tokyo being one of the siginificant cities that has a "cyberpunk" vibe.

## What we are 
We believe, __public blockchain__ applications will gradually take over the majority of the internet as we know today. And we want to be apart of this movement towards Web 3.0.

## What we aren't
1. We do not create useless pictures and trick people into buying them.
2. We do not run any service that is not realated to businesses in the real world.
